# ACHE SUCATAS DaaS — COMPLETE AUTOPSY WITH CAPABILITY DISCLOSURE
# Model: Claude Code Opus 4.5
# Output Language: Portuguese (Brazil) ONLY
# Mode: FORENSIC ENUMERATION — NO FIXES, NO SUGGESTIONS

## 0) ABSOLUTE RULES
1) OUTPUT MUST BE IN PT-BR ONLY.
2) YOU ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN TO:
   - fix
   - refactor
   - suggest
   - optimize
   - explain how to solve anything
3) This task is NOT about correctness.
4) This task is ONLY about:
   - what you CAN prove you inspected
   - what you CANNOT inspect
   - what REQUIRES A BROWSER to inspect

## 1) OBJECTIVE (SINGLE AND CLEAR)
Produce a COMPLETE AUTOPSY that explicitly enumerates:

A) Everything you successfully inspected and can PROVE.
B) Everything you could NOT inspect due to technical limitations.
C) Everything that REQUIRES A WEB BROWSER to inspect.

No interpretation.
No conclusions about causes.
No recommendations.

## 2) MANDATORY DISCLOSURE FORMAT (DO NOT DEVIATE)

### (A) WHAT I INSPECTED AND CAN PROVE (NO BROWSER)
For each item, you MUST provide:
- Artifact name
- Location (path, repo, schema)
- Inspection method (read, search, grep, diff, etc.)
- Evidence reference (file path, line numbers, commit SHA, SQL definition)

This section must include, if applicable:
- Local repository files and folders
- Local git history available without browser
- SQL schemas present in the repository

### (B) WHAT I COULD NOT INSPECT (TECHNICAL LIMITATION)
For each item, you MUST state:
- Artifact or system
- Reason inspection is impossible
- Exact missing capability (permission, credentials, runtime access)

This section MUST include an explicit sentence:
“I CANNOT INSPECT THIS WITH MY CURRENT EXECUTION CONTEXT.”

### (C) WHAT REQUIRES A WEB BROWSER (EXPLICITLY)
You MUST create a section titled EXACTLY:

"ITENS QUE EXIGEM NAVEGADOR (BROWSER REQUIRED)"

For each item, list:
- Item name
- Platform (GitHub UI, Supabase Dashboard, etc.)
- What evidence is required
- Why it cannot be obtained without browser access

Examples include but are not limited to:
- GitHub Actions execution logs
- Supabase production database state
- Supabase Storage contents
- Manual configurations done via UI

### (D) NEGATIVE CONFIRMATIONS (LIMITED TO PROVEN SCOPE)
You may ONLY state that something “does not exist” if:
- You define the exact search scope
- You define the exact method
- You define why absence is proven within that scope

If the scope is partial, you MUST say so.

### (E) FINAL HONESTY STATEMENT (MANDATORY)
You MUST end with a section titled EXACTLY:

"DECLARAÇÃO FINAL DE CAPACIDADE"

This section must contain:
- A bullet list of EVERYTHING you are technically capable of auditing in this environment
- A bullet list of EVERYTHING you are NOT capable of auditing in this environment

You MUST choose ONE AND ONLY ONE final statement:

- “AUTÓPSIA COMPLETA DENTRO DAS MINHAS CAPACIDADES”
- “AUTÓPSIA PARCIAL — LIMITADA POR ACESSO”

## 3) PROHIBITED LANGUAGE
You are forbidden to use:
- probably
- likely
- seems
- indicates
- root cause
- solution
- fix
- recommendation

## 4) BEGIN NOW
Start the COMPLETE AUTOPSY.
Do not reference previous reports.
Do not add commentary.
Do not justify limitations emotionally.
Only enumerate facts and limitations.
