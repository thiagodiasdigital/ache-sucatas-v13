**CONTEXT: PHASE 3 - GRID VIEW SCALING & FILTERS**
**ROLE:** Senior Architect (Logic First).
**TASK:** Refactor Main Auction Query for Pagination and Advanced Date Filtering.

**CURRENT STATUS:**
* Calendar View is FUNCTIONAL.
* We need to upgrade the GRID/LIST View to handle large datasets efficiently.

**REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Server-Side Pagination:**
    * Fetch all auctions but display only **20 cards per page**.
    * Use Supabase `.range((page - 1) * 20, page * 20 - 1)`.
    * **UI:** Add a Pagination Component at the bottom of the Grid:
        * [< Previous] [Page X of Y] [Next >]
        * Disable buttons appropriately at start/end.

2.  **Advanced Date Filters (Top of Grid):**
    * Implement three specific date filters (using Shadcn `DatePicker` or `Popover`):
        * **PNCP Publication Date** (`data_publicacao_pncp`).
        * **Auction Start Date** (`data_inicio_disputa`).
        * **Auction End Date** (`data_fim_disputa`).
    * *Logic:* Filters must be additive (AND logic).

3.  **"Show All" Logic:**
    * Ensure the initial load fetches the first 20 records irrespective of UF *unless* a specific UF is selected.
    * Display total count of records found to calculate total pages.

**TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
* **Performance:** Do NOT filter client-side. All filters must be applied in the Supabase query builder.
* **State:** Manage pagination state (reset to Page 1 when filters change).
* **Output:** Provide the updated `fetchAuctions` logic/hook and the React component code for the Filter/Pagination controls.

**LANGUAGE:** Output explanation in PT-BR. Code in TypeScript.
