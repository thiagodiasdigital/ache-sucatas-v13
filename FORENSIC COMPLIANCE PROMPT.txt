# ACHE SUCATAS DaaS — SECOND AUTOPSY (FORENSIC COMPLIANCE MODE)
# Model: Claude Code Opus 4.5
# Output Language: Portuguese (Brazil) ONLY
# Mission Type: Forensic verification of investigation completeness
# Status: NO REMEDIATION, NO FIXES, NO OPINIONS

## 0) ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1) OUTPUT MUST BE IN PT-BR ONLY.
2) THIS IS NOT A DEBUGGING, FIXING, OR DESIGN TASK.
3) YOU ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN TO:
   - propose fixes
   - suggest refactors
   - recommend changes
   - optimize anything
   - explain “how to solve”
4) Your ONLY mission is to PROVE, WITH HARD EVIDENCE, that you READ and INSPECTED EVERYTHING REQUIRED.
5) Any claim without explicit evidence is INVALID.

## 1) PURPOSE OF THIS SECOND AUTOPSY
Your previous report is under forensic review.

This second autopsy exists ONLY to answer one question:

➡️ Did you ACTUALLY read and inspect ALL relevant artifacts:
- local repository (entire root, all files, all subfolders),
- GitHub repository (full history),
- Supabase (full data surface)?

This task is NOT about correctness of conclusions.
It is about COMPLETENESS and VERIFIABILITY of inspection.

## 2) MANDATORY PROOF STANDARD
For EVERY inspection claim, you MUST provide at least ONE of the following:
- file path + line ranges
- directory listing output
- commit SHA + diff/blame context
- SQL query + returned row counts
- explicit negative proof (“searched, not found”) with scope described

No summaries without proof.
No “analyzed”, “verified”, “checked” statements without evidence.

## 3) REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE (DO NOT DEVIATE)

### (A) ROOT REPOSITORY INVENTORY — COMPLETE AND EXHAUSTIVE
You MUST produce a full inventory of the local project root.

Required format:
- Root directory name
- Full recursive listing by directory
- For EACH directory:
  - purpose (inferred from contents)
  - confirmation of inspection
  - list of files inspected

You MUST explicitly state:
- which directories contain executable logic
- which directories contain SQL
- which directories contain legacy or deprecated artifacts
- which directories contain NO executable relevance

If a directory exists but was NOT inspected, you must say so and explain why.

### (B) SCRIPT & LOGIC EXHAUSTIVENESS CHECK
You MUST list:
- ALL scripts capable of:
  - extracting data
  - transforming data
  - writing to Supabase
- Including:
  - old versions
  - archived scripts
  - unused but present files
  - similarly named scripts across versions

For EACH script:
- file path
- version indicator (if any)
- confirmation of inspection
- whether it writes to DB or not

### (C) GLOBAL FIELD SEARCH — PROOF OF COVERAGE
You MUST prove that you searched for ALL critical fields across the entire repository.

Required fields:
- data_leilao
- data_inicio_propostas
- link_pncp
- valor_estimado
- tipo_leilao
- n_pncp

For EACH field:
- list ALL files where it appears
- list files explicitly searched where it does NOT appear
- identify any shadow/alias names

### (D) GITHUB FORENSICS — FULL HISTORY, NOT SAMPLES
You MUST prove GitHub coverage.

Required evidence:
- list of branches inspected
- confirmation that deleted files were searched (`diff-filter=D`)
- identification of last-known-good commit with full field coverage
- confirmation that no alternative writers/scripts exist in history

You must distinguish clearly:
- facts proven by commit history
- facts inferred (label them explicitly as inferred)

### (E) SUPABASE SURFACE AREA — EXHAUSTIVE ENUMERATION
You MUST enumerate ALL Supabase surfaces inspected:

Required sections:
1) Tables
2) Views
3) Functions / RPCs
4) Triggers
5) Policies (RLS)
6) Scheduled jobs (if any)

For EACH surface:
- object name
- purpose
- confirmation of inspection
- whether it can write, mutate, or filter data

You MUST explicitly state:
- whether ANY writer exists besides the Miner
- whether ANY process can overwrite fields post-insert

### (F) NEGATIVE PROOF SECTION (CRITICAL)
You MUST include a section titled exactly:

"PROVAS NEGATIVAS (O QUE NÃO EXISTE)"

In this section, you must list:
- scripts you confirmed do NOT exist
- pipelines you confirmed do NOT run
- alternative data writers you confirmed do NOT exist

Each negative claim MUST include:
- search scope
- method
- why absence is considered proven

### (G) GAP DECLARATION (MANDATORY HONESTY)
If there is ANY artifact you could NOT inspect, you MUST declare:
- what is missing
- why it could not be accessed
- what exact evidence would be required to close the gap

Failure to declare gaps is considered a protocol violation.

### (H) COMPLIANCE VERDICT
You MUST conclude with a STRICT verdict, choosing ONLY ONE:

- “AUTÓPSIA COMPLETA — TODAS AS FONTES FORAM EXAURIDAS”
- “AUTÓPSIA INCOMPLETA — EXISTEM FONTES NÃO ESGOTADAS”

If incomplete, list EXACTLY which sources remain unproven.

## 4) PROHIBITED LANGUAGE
You are forbidden to use:
- “provavelmente”
- “parece que”
- “indica que”
- “acredita-se”
- “possivelmente”

This is forensic work, not interpretation.

## 5) BEGIN IMMEDIATELY
Start executing the SECOND AUTOPSY now.
Do NOT reference previous conclusions.
Do NOT summarize earlier reports.
Do NOT fix anything.
Do NOT suggest anything.

Only prove what you actually inspected.
